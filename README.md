# Torch-STFT
Working as GPU version of [STFT implemented by SMS-tool](https://github.com/MTG/sms-tools/blob/master/software/models_interface/stft_function.py), that is doing zero phase windowing and fftbuffer

Thanks [nnAudio](https://github.com/KinWaiCheuk/nnAudio) for implementing Conv1D version of STFT
